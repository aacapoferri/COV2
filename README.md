# Hi there! I am Adam A. Capoferri, a predoctoral fellow in the National Cancer Institute-Frederick and the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Georgetown University.The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has brought many scientists together to work on developing vaccines and evolutionary studies. While maybe minor, I am here trying to do my part for some of the analyses I have been working on--see preprint and hopefully published manuscript below. The scripts are in R so you should need RStudio but are pretty easy to use. I have included some fake datasets to help along with formatting if you would like to use any of them.
